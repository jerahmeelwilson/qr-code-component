## My process

I used a mobile first approach to implement this design after I noticed it should look the same on desktop and mobile devices. From there, everything else was straightforward. The most difficult parts were getting the spacing correct and getting the font sizes and font weights to match. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

In the future I am focusing on continuing to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript/React. In addition, I plan to incorporate Bootstrap and other CSS libaries into my projects.
